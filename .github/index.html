    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[I would advise a potential client to take security seriously on his/her website. Web secutity will protect you website and your visitors from potential threaths from intruders. The consequenses of not taking web security seriously can be theft, like account passwords, creditcard information, personal information etc. Hackers with bad intentions have gotten very good at their schemes, making it difficult for people to identify if an email or link is malicious or not. There are many different kinds of web security threaths that can threathen your website, some of these are Cross-site scripting, a malicious code is launched and runs succcessfully on your page, SQL injection, malicous data is sent into the database via the client and cross site request forgery, a user sees a link and gets tricked to completing a payment from an attacker. To keep my clients website safe I would reccomend a few practices: sanitiazion of data, secure authorization and authentication, use a third-party application, continuous deployment/continuous integration, network security and implementation of automatic user timeout. It is very important to keep both your website and your clients information safe. Big security breaches at websites does not make great publisity when media writes articles about clients information that gets stolen. It can affect your reputation as a business and your customers trust in you as a company.]</p>
